<p>In addition to being a <a href="/google-keyword-rank-checker-tool" target="_blank" data-type="page" data-id="10909" rel="noreferrer noopener">keyword rank checker</a>, Nozzle is one of the best SEO competitor analysis tools. It lets you keep tabs on who is doing the best in the SERPs for your industry by showing you:</p>



<ul>
<li>who has the <a href="/blog/finding-your-top-serp-competitors-across-all-your-keyword-groups" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="11494" rel="noreferrer noopener">most top 3, top 5, or top 10 rankings</a>.</li>



<li>which companies own all the <a href="/blog/featured-snippet-competitor-analysis" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="11496" rel="noreferrer noopener">featured snippets</a> and how many each company owns.</li>



<li>who owns the <a href="/blog/google-local-rank-tracking" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="11478" rel="noreferrer noopener">local listings</a> (if you’re in a local SEO market).</li>



<li>which <a href="/blog/video-rank-tracker" target="_blank" data-type="post" data-id="11377" rel="noreferrer noopener">videos are doing the best</a> in the video results inside of Google.</li>
</ul>



<p>Not only can Nozzle help you figure out which domains are doing the best, but it can also show you the highest-ranking URLs. Knowing this can give you a good idea of which URLs you should analyze in terms of your competitors&#8217; on-site optimization and backlinks, using tools like Ahrefs, SEMrush, Moz, or Majestic. This way, you can focus on who is actually doing the best, based on real data, instead of just who you have a hunch about.</p>



<p>Ultimately, you’ll want to monitor a big keyword list on a monthly or quarterly basis to help you keep tabs on all of the SERP competition for your whole industry. This is different from your regular keyword list, which you use to keep track of your daily rankings. Using this huge list, you can see your SEO progress over time and look at how you compare against the landscape of all your competitors. As you report on it every month or quarter, you’ll be able to prove to your clients or your boss that your efforts are paying off.</p>



<p>Most SEOs use multiple tools for different aspects of SEO, like competitive analysis. There are many tools you can pair with Nozzle to accurately analyze your competition to guide your SEO strategy. We asked over 80 SEO practitioners which SERP competition tools they use for competitive analysis and what their favorite features are. Here’s what they said:</p>

<p>There are 3 tools that I use every single time I&#8217;m putting together a strategy for a new prospect and/or developing a new strategy for a new client.</p>



<p>1. The SERPs. Some might call this a cop out, but in my opinion, it is the quickest way to determine what kind of landscape we&#8217;ll be up against. I can also pull a list of top 3 &#8211; 5 results for our seed keywords to determine how competitive each head term is. My favorite feature is to undo the 10 results per page feature from Google search, and then use a chrome extension to pull all of the links on the page for the query.</p>



<p>2. SEMrush. Tried and true. It&#8217;s a quick and dirty way to pull metrics about the client&#8217;s perceived competition, and their true competition from an organic visibility overlap perspective. The organic traffic insights and link analytics are what are most used in this phase. My favorite feature is to bulk compare link profile similarities and gaps.</p>



<p>3. Woorank. This handy chrome extension is a one stop shop for a super lite and fast audit. I can see what technologies, frequently used terms, and even the strength of their security certificate. It&#8217;s what I use on the fly the most.</p>



<p>My favorite feature is the &#8220;technologies&#8221; section breakdown of what the prospect is using. This helps me ask the right kind of questions in the discovery phase.</p>

<blockquote class="wp-block-quote is-style-default">
<p>Personally, I use Ahrefs (for high level analysis), Screaming Frog (for on-page technical issues), and Keyword Surfer (for content length and keyword density at a glance).</p>



<p>I also use one other tool that almost everyone already has (but no one is using):<br>Using Microsoft Word&#8217;s readability feature has been a huge tool in the competitive analysis toolkit. According to sources such as Center for Plain Language, the average American has an 8th grade reading level. By leveraging Word&#8217;s easy to use readability feature, we&#8217;re able to check for opportunities to communicate with customers in a more effective way. We ask, &#8216;are our competitor&#8217;s using language that is too difficult to understand? Can we communicate the message more clearly?&#8217;</p>



<p>User experience is so closely tied to SEO that we have to go beyond just checking for keywords in Title Tags. We have to attack every angle possible. A clear message delivered in the appropriate way can do more for your user experience than almost anything else.</p>



<p>Here&#8217;s how you enable the readability feature in Microsoft Word. File &gt; Options &gt; Proofing &gt; Show Readability Statistics. After that, whenever you click Editor(F7) you&#8217;ll see a pop up once all suggestions have been accepted or ignored.</p>

<p>My SEO competitive analysis tools vary depending on client industry, client prospect geographies, and the question the competitive analysis is answering.</p>



<p><em>For ad hoc research, I start with the Google Ads preview tool for a quick manual check of a handful of key terms in question. I also look for new SERP occupants I might not yet be tracking as competitors, as well as new Google products on SERP. Once I’ve identified which companies are on the SERPs, I run full backlink reports on majestic.com, looking for new backlinks to competitor sites, and for high authority links lost by my site.</em></p>



<p><em>To analyze page performance competition, I run testmysite.thinkwithGoogle.com, and queue up comparison advanced tests on webpagetest.org.</em></p>



<p>For a more strategic competitive analysis, to find lexical or semantic openings, or to plan resources for the upcoming year, I start with manual visual analysis of SERPs on high-volume terms.</p>



<p><em>Competitor xml sitemaps can be helpful in telegraphing competitor content emphasis and site structure.</em></p>



<p><em>Spyfu is decent for Google Ads budgets comparisons. It&#8217;s only somewhat accurate, but dependable for order of magnitude and directionality if you use a long enough timeframe.</em></p>



<p><em>Other tools I like:</em></p>



<p>&#8211; <em>Builtwith.com is awesome for a “cutaway” look at competitor websites, and can give insights for ad strategies.</em></p>



<p>&#8211; <em>The Google Advanced Operators also are a go-to. They&#8217;re nice for getting a sense of a competitors’ owned, earned, and paid properties online.</em></p>

<p>We&#8217;ve recently begun using Ahrefs much more at our agency. We&#8217;ve found that its crawlers seem to identify far more links than similar tools that we previously used at Moz.

This tool gives us prescient knowledge of the keywords that our competition appears to be targeting.

This benefits us to find great link opportunities. But this wouldn’t have been so great if Ahrefs didn’t have the largest database of backlinks.

<p>Being a founder of a Digital Marketing Agency, I have used numerous competitor analysis tools out there but after narrowing it down to my absolute favorite, I can say SEMRush is the best available competitor analysis tool today in my opinion and can help you explore your competitor insights, along with your boosting your SEO efforts.</p>



<p>SEMrush is an all-in-one SEO software but when it comes to competitor analysis SEMrush is great for Keyword Gap Analysis.</p>



<p>Keyword Gap Analysis is the greatest SEMrush feature that I have not come across anywhere else. This feature allows you to set your page in direct competition with up to 4 competitors, to analyze and examine how you can rank above them in Google Search.</p>



<p>This will provide a breakdown of keywords related to your competitors&#8217; websites, and explains where each of these websites ranks for each of them, followed by how usually they are searched, keyword difficulty, and more.</p>

<p>I struggled with your question about which SEO tool is the best for competitive analysis. While there are dozens of tools that provide competitive insights, two that I feel carry equal weight as best-in-class are SEMrush and SpyFu.</p>



<p>Both platforms provide insights into top organic and paid search competitors, including top keywords, sample ad copy and estimated site traffic. What I find most valuable, however, is the estimated monthly traffic originating from paid and organic search for any given domain. The primary reason to put them at a tie, is that their results vary significantly domain to domain, so being able to run a single website through both platforms helps triangulate the best data and competitive insights.</p>

<p>As far as features go, it would be a tie between the Organic Research tool and the Backlink Gap Analysis tool. The Organic Research tool is helpful for seeing what pages and terms are accounting for the most traffic on a competitor’s site.

<p>My favorite tool by far for competitive analysis for SEO is Ahrefs. I&#8217;ve used a ton of tools over the years, including SEMrush, Moz and Majestic, but nothing compares to Ahrefs.

<p>My favorite feature of Ahrefs for analyzing competitors is definitely their &#8220;site explorer&#8221; function. Just plug in your competitor&#8217;s domain and you can get any and every bit of information there is on links related to their site. You can see incoming links to their site broken down by page level, outbound links, their most linked-to pages, and more. It&#8217;s truly incredible how much data you can pull. If you want to try a mass link building campaign, you can scrape prospects for outreach directly from the links to your competitor&#8217;s similar post. I am a huge fan of Ahrefs, and particularly their &#8220;site explorer&#8221; tool. They are awesome for competitor analysis.</p>

<p><em>We use Ahrefs, SEMrush, and ScreamingFrog for our competitive SEO analysis. However, we primarily use Ahrefs as (between Ahrefs, SEMrush, Majestic, and Moz) it has the best backlink indexing capabilities. Ahrefs provides the largest index of backlinks, so our favorite feature when researching a competitor is Ahrefs’ backlink checker. Over time, we have found that a site&#8217;s backlink profile can tell a lot about the style of SEO they are using and where to target our efforts.

<p>Ahrefs is pretty much the best SEO tool for competitive analysis. It gives you a comprehensive overview of what your competitors are doing to get organic traffic and what&#8217;s working for them. I specifically like to look at a couple of things.</p>



<p>First, the keywords section that gives you the keywords that they are ranking for. If you are short of ideas on how to find keywords to target in your SEO campaigns, looking at 2 or 3 competitors&#8217; keywords and doing a Content gap analysis will give you a lot of ideas.</p>



<p>Second, there&#8217;s the back link section that shows all backlinks they have built in the recent past. This is again a great place to start if you are looking for some quick link building opportunities.

<p>Then, I take those questions either directly to Google or to any SEO tool to see what top results come up. Those are my competitors. Often, using Google directly is best because it&#8217;s up to date and you can see all the other results (like &#8220;related searches&#8221; or &#8220;people also searched for&#8221; on the right side, below the knowledge panel), and other search features.</p>

<p>For a free tool, I feel UberSuggest does a great job to let the foundation straight. You enter the domain name of the competitor and track the website performance, backlink profile and current traffic per month.</p>



<p>For an industry recognized tool, I feel Ahrefs is best in the business. Primarily because of the break up they offer in terms of content exploration, website quality issues and suggestions for acquiring links under specific domains.</p>

<p>2) We talk to prospects and clients ALL THE TIME. I have my team to thank for that. Everyone is customer-centric, and not only does that impact our product development team, but it helps us produce content that addresses real concerns and topics on the front of our customers&#8217; minds (and in their own words, no less). I attribute this open communication to the main reason we perform well in search rankings. We are deeply connected to our audience, and no SEO software can replicate that.</p>

<p>According to me, Ahrefs is one of the most dependable competitor analysis tools, and it provides much more depth analysis.</p>



<p>We have been using only Ahrefs for four years and never felt like our digital marketing strategies are not working correctly. Ahrefs plan starts from $99 p.m; to $999 p.m, and even you can try any plan as a trial base only at just $7.</p>



<p>Today, Ahrefs has a ton of features that make it a direct competitor to SEMrush, including:</p>



<p>&#8211; Keyword research features<br>&#8211; Keyword competitor analysis<br>&#8211; Technical SEO tools (like a site audit feature)<br>&#8211; Rank tracking</p>



<p>Ahrefs site explorer feature will provide you all the required information such as backlinks, domain rating, keywords, traffic, traffic value. Even at the same time, you can check 200URLs at one time by using the Ahrefs batch analysis option.</p>



<p>You can use Ahrefs for multiple purposes, and its backlink option will provide you A to Z information about backlinks such as broken backlinks, new or lost backlinks, most link domains, number of dofollow, nofollow, education, org, number of referring domains, and much more information about backlinks.</p>



<p>To create content, its content explorer option is just incredible. You need to add the keyword. It will show you top-performing content topics; based on it, you can create your killer content outline. Certain content will definitely not only rank well in SERP, but it will stay for a long time in top results.</p>



<p>You can do many things with Ahrefs such as competitor analysis, site audit, keyword research, content gap analysis, domain comparison, top competing domains, top-performing pages, broken links, PPC keywords, landing pages, Ads. You can use this tool for link-building purposes too. Use of Ahrefs is entirely limitless.</p>



<p>I would suggest investing in Ahrefs means increasing your ROI for sure.</p>

<p>As part of my role as a growth marketer, I&#8217;ve used Ahrefs and SEMRush for competitor analysis. I prefer SEMRush as it offers a lot of great PPC analysis along with SEO. The Position Tracking tool gives a great breakdown on competitor visibility for target keywords and the amount of traffic particular sites receive for specific keywords.</p>



<p>This tells me how visible we are vs competitors in the search results, but also which keywords actually bring in the lion&#8217;s share of traffic that we need to pursue more aggressively.</p>



<p>My favourite feature in SEMRush is the On-Page SEO suggestions for making improvements. In particular, suggesting relevant LSI keywords and related phrases that appear on other sites ranking well for the phrases we are targeting. Because intent is so critical in search these days, having as many relevant phrases to the topic is important for ranking well in the SERPs.</p>

<p>My favorite feature is the backlink profile that you can pull with the filters in place. It allows you to get an idea of the competitor&#8217;s link building strategy and what links they have.</p>

The amount of data is really overwhelming &#8211; you can check things like best organic keywords seeing what generates the best organic traffic to their site, explore the estimated traffic and quality of their link-building efforts.

<p>Though I have used many SEO tools for competitive analysis, Brand Mention gave me an extra edge when analyzing our competitor strategies. It is easy to spy on a competitor from different angles and know precisely where the competition stands.</p>



<p>With this tool, you can see your competitor&#8217;s evolution throughout time and learn what their strong points are, where exactly they get mentioned, and what topics they are focusing on.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a feature in the dashboard, &#8220;unlinked&#8221;. It shows all the places where your brand name, maybe a blog post, video, social media post, was mentioned but did not link back to the website.</p>



<p>It makes us easy to reach out to the person or website owner who has mentioned your brand or content and ask for a friendly favor to link to your website. For SEO, links do a massive job, and this is one of the easiest ways to earn quality backlinks to boost the brand&#8217;s rankings.</p>

<p>We have been using SEMrush for quite a while and it is one of the best tools for SEO analysis of the competitors for small and medium-sized businesses..

<p>SpyFu also provides us with a comprehensive list of competitors for any domain we analyze. It has been really helpful for us to identify our top competitors. It is better than many competitor analysis tools for the analysis of the domain and its distribution on the first page of search results on any search engine.</p>

<p>One of the tools I use for competitive analysis is Ahrefs. This tool has a site explorer that helps you understand what links are working for your competitors. The Ahrefs site explorer shows you your competitor’s most linked content to see how you can work on something similar for yourself. The tool also helps with understanding competitor’s PPC keywords and learning from their PPC ads.</p>



<p>I also use KWFinder. KWFinder has a competitor based keyword searcher that helps you with some essential knowledge about your competitors&#8217; keywords. This information includes top keywords your competitors rank for, the highest organic position reached for each keyword, the Estimated Traffic per Month based on the search volume and the organic position, etc. This tool provides you with information that can be pivotal in your decision for SEO strategies.</p>



<p>Ahrefs is my favorite tool because of how complete it is. It does not just restrict to keywords but also gives you insight into PPC ads. It lets you know about every detail of your competitor&#8217;s work, including broken pages, best-performing keywords, organic keywords, their superfans, and most importantly, it helps you identify your competitors as the very first step.</p>



<p>My favorite feature has to be the Ahrefs site explorer. The prime reason being how easy it is to use and the vital information that it shows. Ahrefs has helped with some in-depth knowledge about my competitor’s PPC ads to help me implement strategies accordingly.</p>

<p>We personally use Ahrefs. Searching for your competitor’s backlinks is something that Ahrefs does really well. It allows you to see a website’s basic features through its Site Explorer Tool.</p>



<p>Doing that will take you to a page where there are so many metrics that you will not have time to look at everything. From Referring pages, traffic and backlinks, Ahrefs got you covered. Most notable out of these is the Backlinks section. You can go to this page when you click on it on the left sidebar.</p>



<p>What I love about this part is that it does more than just list the backlinks. All backlinks are clickable and it includes the Anchor Text and page that it is linking to. All of these are helpful if you are just planning to have your own SEO campaign.</p>



<p>First, it can show you all of the backlinks of your main competitors. This will show you the type of websites that you are up against through the number of backlinks that they have and the quality of the websites linking to them.</p>



<p>Second, you can get a glimpse of the keywords that they are aiming for. You can see that some of their anchor text will be targeting a particular keyword. You can then research this keyword to find out why they are targeting this.</p>



<p>Third, you can also see the pages that other websites are linking to. Let’s face it. Not all pages in a website is a winner. But Ahrefs let you dissect a website so that you can find out the pages that other websites are linking to.</p>



<p>All these can help you decide on the keywords that you will target and how you are going to promote your website in order to dominate those keywords.</p>

It is useful not only for monitoring data for my own site’s performance, but for competitive analysis as well.
