You probably thought about your file structure and module structure, making sure it fit into a widely used style guide that makes sense. Here at Nozzle, we take our style guides very seriously, and tried to make the best decision on how to modularize, and make our codebase extensible. One problem though, as it seems we could never get rid of were hard-coded image references, and the like. Anything pointing toward a static asset always seemed to start out like so:\n```html\n<img src=\"app/path/to/my/assets/images/myImage.png\"/>\n```\n\nAssuming that you had a lot of images in your design, you probably got used to using find > replace a lot if your file structure changed. But what if your modules needed to be independent and sandboxed? We’ve come up with a tiny trick to help your modules be completely independent, regardless of where they sit in your file structure. This also opens up some shortcuts for a reverse-like dependency injection (importing one module that contains all references to child modules, or simply using a single child module with its parent as a dependency)\nEnter Relative AngularJS Modules\nConsider the parent module:\n```javascript\n  (function() {\n    'use strict';\n\n    var module = angular.module('myApp.things', []);\n\n    var all = angular.module('myApp.things.all', [\n      'myApp.things',\n      'things.someThing',\n      'things.someOtherThing',\n      'things.someOtherOtherThing',\n    ]);\n\n    module.root = '/path/to/this/thing/';\n\n    module.config(function(stateHelperProvider) {\n      stateHelperProvider.setNestedState({\n          name: 'things',\n          url: '/things',\n          templateUrl: module.root + 'directives/things/things.directive.html',\n      });\n    });\n  })();\n```\n    \nThe module is declared, and a shortcut method for importing it and/or all of its children is also created. Then the module itself gains a paths property on which you can store any path to the root, partials, submodules or whatever else you need. Those properties can then be used to create constants for your module to use in your templates, bind to a scope property for use in image src or any other thing needing a file location. But really, what this allows in child modules is even cooler…\n\n```javascript\n  (function() {\n    'use strict';\n\n    var module = angular.module('things.someThing', ['myApp.things']);\n    var parent = angular.module('myApp.things');\n\n    module.root = parent.root + 'sub_module/someThing/';\n\n    module.config(function(stateHelperProvider) {\n      stateHelperProvider.setNestedState({\n          name: 'things.someThing',\n          url: \"/someThing\",\n          templateUrl: module.root + 'someThing.html',\n      });\n    });\n  })();\n```\n\nThe child module is created with its dependency on the parent module, but then we also reference the parent module itself, then utilize the parent modules paths properties (or constants if you’ve created them) to build the paths for the child module. Those paths can then be accessed the same way by any child modules. This is AWESOME! Because as you can now guess, you can change the location of a module directory in your file structure, and as long as you reflect the changes in your module, all of your template, image, etc references will remain intact!\n\nHope this helps!\n\nEnjoy.\n\n","category":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z8uwv83tofbw"}},"id":"3hIm7ovZeoESUckI0esuUe","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-05-27T00:06:33.941Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-24T14:11:14.295Z","revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"devCategory"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Front End","slug":"front-end"}}],"featuredImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z8uwv83tofbw"}},"id":"5P0Vc2th60GUICYYuOUEM0","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-05-27T00:12:17.943Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-27T00:12:17.943Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Screen Shot 2017-05-26 at 6.11.57 PM","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/z8uwv83tofbw/5P0Vc2th60GUICYYuOUEM0/660f3cca743c032eebb81b4c9c7c63ec/Screen_Shot_2017-05-26_at_6.11.57_PM.png","details":{"size":94092,"image":{"width":541,"height":465}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2017-05-26 at 6.11.57 PM.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},"date":"2017-05-26"}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z8uwv83tofbw"}},"id":"6DUOtWGM2QU6c424G86eCo","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-05-27T00:18:29.043Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-21T00:55:09.089Z","revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"devPost"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"ng-Tri-Toggle, an AngularJS Triple-State Checkbox Directive","slug":"ng-tri-toggle-an-angularjs-triple-state-checkbox-directive","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z8uwv83tofbw"}},"id":"6XMI2BAaCQ8wsGAkeyAK6e","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-05-26T23:54:10.979Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-26T23:54:10.979Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"1kUEViTN4EmGiEaaeC6ouY"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Tanner Linsley","profilePhoto":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z8uwv83tofbw"}},"id":"7m7KDlbTH2Q6C8aQAMyIoY","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-05-26T23:53:41.665Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-26T23:53:41.665Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"tanner","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/z8uwv83tofbw/7m7KDlbTH2Q6C8aQAMyIoY/089d6ce2a0600e69745ffa9ce9abc7a1/tanner.jpg","details":{"size":40644,"image":{"width":400,"height":400}},"fileName":"tanner.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"biography":"Tanner is obsessive and passionate about Javascript, React, UI/UX, Data Visualization and all things web.

The scenarios are extremely rare, but when come across, people resort to strange ways of creating three way toggleable checkboxes, and hacky select inputs. In Nozzle’s specific situation, we needed a checkbox that could harness 2 “active” or toggleable values, and an off or null state. This would allow us to essentially “turn on” a filter that my have two “on” states eg. an off state, a true state, and a false state.\n\n## A custom directive. Simple and elegant.\nHere, I forewent dealing with checkboxes and select inputs all together, and focused on using angular’s magical databinding and directives to get the job done. Click here for the github repo! The AngularJS Triple-State Checkbox\nThe HTML in your template\n```html\n<tri-toggle ng-model=\"myValue\"></tri-toggle>\n```\nResults in a toggle capable of three states:\n\n![ng-tri-toggle](//images.contentful.com/z8uwv83tofbw/2lclksbC8ocWG2QKYysGIc/8b2e6ae7e48b5c5d99a6b0c8b4261f2f/ng-tri-toggle.png)\n\nThis is the Javascript you don’t see:\n```javascript\n  var ngTriToggle = angular.module('ngTriToggle', []);\n  ngTriToggle\n      .directive('triToggle', function($timeout) {\n          return {\n              restrict: 'E',\n              replace: false,\n              transclude: true,\n              scope: {\n                  ngChange: '&',\n                  val: '=ngModel',\n                  ngTrueVal: '=?',\n                  ngngFalseVal: '=?',\n                  ngNoVal: '=?',\n                  tanner: '&'\n              },\n              template: '<div class=\"tri-toggle-wrap\" ng-class=\"{\\'true\\': val==ngTrueVal, \\'false\\': val==ngFalseVal}\" ng-click=\"toggle()\"><div class=\"tri-toggle-false\" ng-click=\"toggleFalse()\"></div><div class=\"tri-toggle-true\" ng-click=\"toggleTrue()\"></div><div class=\"tri-toggle-handle\" ng-click=\"toggleNone()\"></div></div>',\n              link: function(scope) {\n\n                  if (!angular.isDefined(scope.ngTrueVal)) {\n                      scope.ngTrueVal = 1;\n                  }\n                  if (!angular.isDefined(scope.ngFalseVal)) {\n                      scope.ngFalseVal = 0;\n                  }\n                  if (!angular.isDefined(scope.ngNoVal)) {\n                      scope.ngNoVal = null;\n                  }\n\n                  if (!angular.isDefined(scope.val)) {\n                      scope.val = scope.ngNoVal;\n                  }\n\n                  scope.toggle = function() {\n                      if (scope.val === scope.ngTrueVal) {\n                          scope.val = scope.ngFalseVal;\n                      } else if (scope.val === scope.ngFalseVal) {\n                          scope.val = scope.ngNoVal;\n                      } else {\n                          scope.val = scope.ngTrueVal;\n                      }\n                      if (typeof scope.ngChange != 'undefined') {\n                          $timeout(function() {\n                              scope.ngChange(scope.val);\n                          });\n                      }\n                  };\n              },\n          };\n      });\n```\n\nIt gives you the option to define custom true, false and null values:\n\n```javascript\n  <tri-toggle\n      ng-model=\"myValue\"\n      ng-true-val=\"1\"\n      ng-false-val=\"0\"\n      ng-no-val=\"-1\">\n  </tri-toggle>\n```\n\nAnd also gives you a handy callback:\n```javascript\n  <tri-toggle\n      ng-change=\"myFunction()\"\n      ng-model=\"myValue\"\n  </tri-toggle>\n```\n\n**Note: This callback is not a watcher. To detect programmatic changes to your model, set up a `$scope.$watch('myValue')` on your ng-model variable. That’s It!**\n\nNow it’s super easy to create as many tri-toggles as you want with absolutely zero checkbox or select input hacking!\n\nEnjoy!\n","category":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z8uwv83tofbw"}},"id":"3hIm7ovZeoESUckI0esuUe","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-05-27T00:06:33.941Z","updatedAt":"2017-08-24T14:11:14.295Z","revision":3,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"devCategory"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Front End","slug":"front-end"}}],"tags":["angular","ui"],"featuredImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z8uwv83tofbw"}},"id":"2lclksbC8ocWG2QKYysGIc","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-05-27T00:18:07.496Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-27T00:18:07.496Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"ng-tri-toggle","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/z8uwv83tofbw/2lclksbC8ocWG2QKYysGIc/8b2e6ae7e48b5c5d99a6b0c8b4261f2f/ng-tri-toggle.png","details":{"size":1011,"image":{"width":125,"height":136}},"fileName":"ng-tri-toggle.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z8uwv83tofbw"}},"id":"6xyqzFy3mMyM0uYee44E2w","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-05-27T00:22:55.615Z","updatedAt":"2017-09-01T19:28:59.317Z","revision":2,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"devPost"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Authentication: Cookies vs JWTs and why you’re doing it wrong","slug":"authentication-cookies-vs-jwts-and-why-you-re-doing-it-wrong","author":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z8uwv83tofbw"}},"id":"1bqi4ZLbQWIMsW0eIuaMiQ","type":"Entry","createdAt":"2017-05-26T23:54:57.340Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-26T23:54:57.340Z","revision":1,"contentType":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"ContentType","id":"1kUEViTN4EmGiEaaeC6ouY"}},"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"name":"Derek Perkins","profilePhoto":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"z8uwv83tofbw"}},"id":"3auYhiW5S0Q0OiQUsiaw8K","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-05-26T23:54:44.892Z","updatedAt":"2017-05-26T23:54:44.892Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"derek","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/z8uwv83tofbw/3auYhiW5S0Q0OiQUsiaw8K/05bd1ead209a80fe9205e2b0b61c576e/derek.jpg","details":{"size":36485,"image":{"width":391,"height":391}},"fileName":"derek.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"biography":"Derek is a golang developer.
